# Contributing to LLM R&D Platform

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the LLM R&D Platform as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LLM-RnD.git
cd LLM-RnD

# Set up backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Set up frontend
cd web_interface/frontend
npm install
cd ../..

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Start development services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Run backend
python run_api.py

# Run frontend (in another terminal)
cd web_interface/frontend
npm start
```

## Code Style

### Python
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter)
- Use docstrings for all functions and classes

```python
def example_function(param: str, optional_param: int = 10) -> dict:
    """
    Brief description of the function.
    
    Args:
        param: Description of param
        optional_param: Description of optional param
        
    Returns:
        Description of return value
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: When param is invalid
    """
    pass
```

### TypeScript/React
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use proper prop types

```typescript
interface ComponentProps {
  title: string;
  optional?: boolean;
}

const ExampleComponent: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ title, optional = false }) => {
  return <div>{title}</div>;
};
```

## Testing

### Backend Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_api_integration.py -v
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd web_interface/frontend

# Run tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Run end-to-end tests
python -m pytest tests/test_end_to_end.py -v
```

## Code Quality Tools

### Python
```bash
# Format code
black .

# Sort imports
isort .

# Lint code
flake8 .

# Type checking
mypy .
```

### TypeScript
```bash
cd web_interface/frontend

# Lint
npm run lint

# Format
npm run format

# Type check
npm run type-check
```

## Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(api): add cost tracking endpoint
fix(frontend): resolve authentication token refresh
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(evaluation): add unit tests for metrics calculation
```

## Issue and Bug Reports

Use GitHub issues to track bugs. Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

### Bug Report Template
```markdown
**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Expected behavior**
